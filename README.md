1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given the framework without the reinforcement learning algorithm, instead, instructions were provided in the same area where my additions were made. 

2. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists develop and implement mathematical and logical theories to tackle problems related to software and hardware. 
It matters because computer scientists address critical issues that make our lives easier and can even save lives, depending on the domain they work in.

3. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach every problem by first understanding and breaking it down logically, similar to a math word problem. Often, I can represent parts of the problem mathematically as an equation, which helps me create pseudocode for whatever I plan on developing. While this approach only works for me in certain types of problems, it provides a strong foundation for the development process in many cases.

4. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethically, I am responsible for developing code that is my own and for abstaining from sharing or collaborating with those who are not authorized to see or work on it. For the end user, I am responsible for creating secure code to keep their data safe, making it collaborative-friendly to prevent mistakes that could lead to future vulnerabilities, and, lastly, for speaking out when I am asked to work on something that is immoral or unjust.

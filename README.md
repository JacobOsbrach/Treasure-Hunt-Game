1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given the framework without the reinforcement learning algorithm, instead, instructions were provided in the same area where my additions were made. 

2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists develop and implement mathematical and logical theories to tackle problems related to software and hardware. 
It matters because computer scientists address critical issues that make our lives easier and can even save lives, depending on the domain they work in.

4. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

5. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
